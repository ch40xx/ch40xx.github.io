### Machine Learning
    When a machine learns stuff; relationship between outcomes and events from a  
    given data by deriving mathematical functions.

There are 4 types of machine learning:
- Supervised Learning
- Unsupervised Learning
- Reinforced Learning
- Generative AI 

## Supervised Learning

When the data is given with the correct ouptut as well.  
So, the model just has to find out what is the relationship between them - Helps in **Prediction** & **Classification**.

There are two types of **Supervised Learning**:

1. Regression : Helps in prediciting number outcomes from the data provided.
2. Classification: Helps to classify data into which group it fits best.

## Unsupervised Learning

The data is given to the model to find out patterns on their own.  
Later, the human can lean into it to label the data classified

## Reinforced Learning

Also a type of machine learning system that gives rewards, penalties to the model based on the actions it performs in a controlled environment.

## Generative AI 

A class of models that creates things from the user input(prompt).
It can take an create combination of these things :

* Text - to text
* Text - to image
* Text - to video
* Images - to text 
* etc..
